# myFirstGithubRepo
This repo is used to upscale my git skills. Upgrade yo!

#This is a title, use "#" at the start of the line

Isn't this _awesome_? Use "_" around the words for italics.

But if you have made some ~~mistaces~~ mistakes , then don't worry, use "~~" around the word for strike through.

And to make it *pop*, use "*" for bold

But enough with the simple stuff, let's code! use "```" around the code:
```
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
```
What about some tables? Use your force, I mean dashes and stuff. _|
